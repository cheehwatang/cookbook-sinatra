# Cookbook Sinatra

Cookbook Sinatra is a simple web app prototype to search for recipes and store recipe information for future reference.

This is part of a learning project for the MVC software architectural pattern.

To learn more about Sinatra, please visit [Sinatra Documentation](https://sinatrarb.com/documentation.html).

## Installation

To test out the prototype, please make sure Ruby is installed in your machine.
Check out [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rubyinstaller) for further information.

Once Ruby is installed, download the repository.

In your terminal, navigate to the folder downloaded, and run the command to fetch the gems specified in the ```Gemfile```.

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

Simply run the program from your terminal:

```bash
ruby app.rb
```

You should get this output:
